# 🔄 Single Organization Per User - System Update

## ✅ Complete System Update

I've successfully updated the system so that each user has **only ONE organization** instead of multiple organizations.

---

## 🎯 What Changed

### 1. **URL Structure Simplified**
- **OLD:** `/organizer/organizations/{id}` (required organization ID)
- **NEW:** `/organizer/organizations` (automatically shows user's organization)

### 2. **Route Changes**
```php
// OLD - Resource routes with ID
Route::resource('organizations', OrganizerOrganizationController::class);

// NEW - Simplified routes without ID
Route::get('/organizations', 'index')           // Show my organization
Route::get('/organizations/create', 'create')   // Create new
Route::post('/organizations', 'store')          // Store new
Route::get('/organizations/edit', 'edit')       // Edit my org
Route::put('/organizations', 'update')          // Update my org
```

### 3. **Controller Logic Updated**
**`OrganizerOrganizationController.php`**

#### Index Method (Shows Single Organization):
```php
public function index()
{
    // Get the user's single organization
    $organization = auth()->user()->organizationsOwned()
        ->with(['category', 'socialLinks', 'events', 'followers'])
        ->first();
    
    // If user doesn't have an organization yet, redirect to create
    if (!$organization) {
        return redirect()->route('organizer.organizations.create')
            ->with('info', 'Please create your organization to get started.');
    }
    
    $followersCount = $organization->followers->count();
    $followers = $organization->followers()
        ->orderBy('organization_followers.created_at', 'desc')
        ->get();

    return view('organizer.organizations.show', compact('organization', 'followersCount', 'followers'));
}
```

#### Edit Method (No ID Required):
```php
public function edit()
{
    // Automatically get the user's organization
    $organization = auth()->user()->organizationsOwned()->firstOrFail();
    
    $this->authorize('update', $organization);
    
    $categories = OrgCategory::all();

    return view('organizer.organizations.edit', compact('organization', 'categories'));
}
```

#### Update Method (No ID Required):
```php
public function update(Request $request)
{
    // Automatically get the user's organization
    $organization = auth()->user()->organizationsOwned()->firstOrFail();
    
    $this->authorize('update', $organization);
    
    // Validation and update...
    
    return redirect()->route('organizer.organizations.index')
        ->with('success', 'Organization updated successfully!');
}
```
